# To Fix

- Editing Projects can be broken by removing a site supervisor then adding the same site supervisor

- Attempting to view an employees projects while they aren't assigned to a project crashes everything

# To Add

- Notes to projects (type: textarea)

- Each employee needs to be able to have multiple emergency contacts (each ICE has a name and a phone number)
