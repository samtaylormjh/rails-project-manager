# To Fix

- First ICE not being ticked primary by default

- Very rarely after creating a new employee the employees table will only display the new employee until the page is refreshed

# To Add

- Another has_many to employees

- (maybe?) Notes as an array, display a list of notes above the note form that updates as each note is added
