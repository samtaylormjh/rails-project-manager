# To Fix

- Editing Projects can be broken by removing a site supervisor then adding the same site supervisor

- Attempting to expand an employees projects after creating a new employee causes the expanded table to appear blank

- Editing site supervisors broke once then started working and now i can't replicate it

- After creating a new employee only the new employee is displayed on index until refreshed sometimes?

# To Add

- Notes to projects (type: textarea)

- Testing
