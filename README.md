# To Fix

- Editing Projects can be broken by removing a site supervisor then adding the same site supervisor

# To Add

- If a project has more than one site supervisor display their names separated by commas

- First ICE ticked primary by default

- Testing

# Reducer stuff

- Attempting to expand an employees projects after creating a new employee causes the expanded table to appear blank

- Editing site supervisors broke once then started working and now i can't replicate it

- After creating a new employee only the new employee is displayed on index until refreshed sometimes?
